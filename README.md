## Overview

This repository is a collection of diverse projects featuring Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The projects here demonstrate various applications of GUI development, ranging from hardware interaction to standalone software tools.

## Project Categories

Projects in this repository may include, but are not limited to:

1. **Hardware Interaction GUIs**
   - Interfaces for microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
   - Control panels for electronic components

2. **Data Visualization Tools**
   - Real-time data plotting
   - Interactive charts and graphs

3. **Utility Applications**
   - File management tools
   - System monitoring dashboards

4. **Educational Software**
   - Interactive learning modules

- Tkinter
- PyQt
- Serial communication libraries (for hardware projects)

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions and requirements. Generally, you'll need:

- Python 3.x (preferably via Anaconda)
- Relevant Python libraries (specified in each project's README)
- Additional hardware or software dependencies (if applicable)

## Usage
